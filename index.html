            <p>Hi! My name is Sabrina Vega and I'm high school senior that will be graduating in June of 2015. In the Fall I will be starting as a college freshman at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science. I first became interested in technology when I was a just a kid messing around on old PCs, playing with my mom's PalmPilot and taking apart Spy Gear toys. Since then I have grown to love learning about computers and programming. </p>
            <p> Through my junior and senior year of high school I discovered the endless ways that coding can change our world. I really didn't know much about coding so I started looking where everyone does: I Googled it. From there I began taking online classes, tinkering with Arduino, enrolled in my school's AP Computer Sciene class and joined the Robotics Club. In my senior year I was chosen as a National Runner-Up and North Florida Winner for the NCWIT's 2015 Award for Aspirations in Computing. Although senior year is coming to a close, I am excited about the opportunities ahead of me. This is just the start of my journey in discovering where I can make an impact in the tech world.
